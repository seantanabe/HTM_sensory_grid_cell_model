# HTM_sensory_grid_cell_model

Replicating results from Lewis et al., 2019's 'Locations in the Neocortex: A Theory of Sensorimotor Object Recognition Using Cortical Grid Cells'.
Currently a work in progress; experiencing issues with sustaining activity between grid and sensory cells during the inference steps.
